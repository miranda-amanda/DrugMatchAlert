#### Description:
This web application assesses the potential risks of combining two types of medications or drugs. Users input two drug types and click 'verify' to receive an alert categorized as 'green alert,' 'yellow alert,' or 'red alert,' indicating the risk level associated with the drug combination. Each alert provides details on the risks, emphasizing that the application is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This project was created as the final project for Harvard's online Introduction to Computer Science course.

Technologies Used:

Flask: Python web framework for backend logic.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions and dynamic updates.
SQLite: Stores drug interaction data.
Bootstrap & CSS: Enhance the visual design and user interface.

The application features modal pop-ups for clear, concise alert messages, improving user experience. It is built for simplicity and rapid development using Flask and SQLite, with a focus on usability and accessibility.

This project incorporated course activities and lessons, with additional assistance from ChatGPT to refine code and achieve the desired results.
